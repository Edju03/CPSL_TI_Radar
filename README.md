# CPSL_TI_Radar Python Repository

This repo includes the CPSL_TI_Radar Python Module, the required firmware, and configurations for interfacing with the TI IWRs and TI DCA1000 data capture card. There is also additional software that can be used to re-configure the DCA1000's ethernet network configuration so as to operate multiple radar's simultaneously.

To get started, please see the following readme files:
* [CPSL TI Radar](./CPSL_TI_Radar/README.md): readme for installing and using the CPSL_TI_Radar module
* [DCA_Programming](./DCA_Programming/README.md):readme for re-programming the DCA1000's ethernet network configuration.
