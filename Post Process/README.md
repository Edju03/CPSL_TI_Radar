# Post Processing code

## Code Descriptions


Useful Codes:

MMWaveDevice: Used to set up the profile and configuration 
NoVisualization: Estimator class (Two profile) 
estimator: estimator class but reads cfg file instead of json file in NoVisualiation (Two profile)
MultipleProfileSeperatePeriod: Plots adc data, range doppler plot, and other useful plots for post analysis
GraphPrediction: GraphGenration + Prediction (Two profile)


To run the code you need to have a json file and bin file (or cfg and bin file for NoVisualization)



You can generate the json and bin file using mmWaveStudio software.

Identify the file path and modify in the code to be able to run.
